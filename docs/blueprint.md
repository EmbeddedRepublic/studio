## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A very light, desaturated green (#F0FAF5), evoking a clean, professional feel. This will provide a subtle hint of the green accent requested by the user, while prioritizing an airy, neutral appearance.
- Primary color: A muted, mid-tone green (#77B388). This hue evokes efficiency and knowledge without being overwhelming, while responding to the request for an accent green.
- Accent color: A subtly contrasting, slightly desaturated yellow-green (#A6C96A), used for interactive elements and key highlights. This remains analogous to the primary color.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern, neutral, and machined aesthetic suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use simple, minimalist icons that complement the clean design. Icons should be related to formulas and calculations.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy. Ensure key elements like the input field, formula display, and copy button are easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as a smooth transition when the formula is generated, to enhance user experience.
